Description: ==========
        Touchwatch
        ==========
        
        Touchwatch is a small Django app to watch a directory for changes
        and if any found, touch a file (to trigger a server restart).
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "touchwatch" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'touchwatch',
            ]
        
        2. Include the polls URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            from touchwatch.views import wsgitime
            if settings.DEBUG:
                urlpatterns += path('wt/', wsgitime, name='wsgitime'),
        
        3. Include the template at the bottom of your base.html file
        
            {% include "touchwatch/js.html" %}
        
        4.. Set the path of the file you want to touch in your settings file
        
            TOUCHWATCH_PATH = "%s/uwsgi.ini" % APP_DIR
        
        5.. Set the path of the folder you want to watch in your settings file
        
            TOUCHWATCH_FOLDER = APP_DIR
        
        ============
        How it works
        ============
        
        From the commandline run the management command 'touchwatch':
        
            python manage.py touchwatch
        
        This will then sit and watch for changes to the file defined in TOUCHWATCH_FOLDER, when changes are seen
        then the file defined in TOUCHWATCH_PATH will be touched.  A small piece of JS runs on all pages on the
        browser which looks for a change to the touched time of the defined file.  When the time changes,
        the JS flashes the background colour and refreshes the page.
